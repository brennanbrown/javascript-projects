# Web Development Projects

## [Sortable Table and Arrays](https://brennanbrown.github.io/javascript-projects/sortable-tables)

This repository demonstrates a portfolio piece that addresses some of the common interview questions on arrays, sorting algorithms, and optimizing code performance. In preparing for the next technical interview with further understanding of key concepts, such as the insertion sort and merge sort algorithms, as well as how to create algorithms. This code was based off the course "Web Portfolio Projects: Sortable Table and Arrays" by Leigh Lawhon.

See notes for this project [**here**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/javascript-projects/blob/master/sortable-tables/README.md).

Topics include:

- Sorting your table efficiently
- Filtering null values and sorting nodes
- Sorting algorithms, including merge sort and insertion sort
- Performance testing
- Creating your own algorithm
- Design components and adding icons

## [Binding and Propagation](https://brennanbrown.github.io/javascript-projects/flashcards)

This project explores some more advanced JavaScript concepts—including how to manage propagation and binding—with interactive card games. This includes animations in CSS3, looking at three contexts of `this` with methods, and adding a shuffle function and object lifecycles. The project also looks at how to use prototypical inheritance to optimize your code, and more. This code was based off the course "Web Portfolio Projects: Binding and Propagation" by Leigh Lawhon.

See notes for this project [**here**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/javascript-projects/blob/master/flashcards/README.md).

Topics include:

- Working with prototype and dynamic elements
- Using bind, call, and apply
- Using the Fisher–Yates formula
- When to use `e.preventDefault()` and when to avoid it
- Drag-and-drop life cycle
- Using prototypical inheritance to optimize your code

## Rebound: Mobile Game Programming

This project explores game creation with JavaScript as a way of enhancing skills in all areas of development. With insight into HTML objects, handling user input, implementing a game loop, determining how objects interact, and styling all the elements with CSS. There's also music and sound effects incorperated, as well as emulation with iOS and Android devices. This code was based off the course "Vanilla JavaScript: Mobile Game Programming" by Tom Duffy.

See notes for this project [**here**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/javascript-projects/blob/master/rebound-game/README.md).

Topics include:

- Defining conditions, styling, and positioning with CSS
- Defining objects with JavaScript
- Creating replacement animation with JavaScript
- Animating objects with formulas
- Simulating boundary collisions
- Handling keyboard events and adding event listeners for mobile events
- Testing the game on mobile emulators and adding game controls
