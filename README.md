## [Sortable Table and Arrays](https://github.com/brennanbrown/javascript-projects/tree/master/sortable-tables)

This repository demonstrates a portfolio piece that addresses some of the common interview questions on arrays, sorting algorithms, and optimizing code performance. In preparing for the next technical interview with further understanding of key concepts, such as the insertion sort and merge sort algorithms, as well as how to create algorithms. This code was based off the course "Web Portfolio Projects: Sortable Table and Arrays" by Leigh Lawhon.

See notes for this project [**here**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/javascript-projects/blob/master/sortable-tables/README.md).

Topics include:

- Sorting your table efficiently
- Filtering null values and sorting nodes
- Sorting algorithms, including merge sort and insertion sort
- Performance testing
- Creating your own algorithm
- Design components and adding icons

## [Binding and Propagation](https://github.com/brennanbrown/javascript-projects/tree/master/flashcards)

This project explores some more advanced JavaScript concepts—including how to manage propagation and binding—with interactive card games. This includes animations in CSS3, looking at three contexts of `this` with methods, and adding a shuffle function and object lifecycles. The project also looks at how to use prototypical inheritance to optimize your code, and more. This code was based off the course "Web Portfolio Projects: Binding and Propagation" by Leigh Lawhon.

See notes for this project [**here**](https://github.com/brennanbrown/javascript-projects/blob/master/flashcards/README.md).

Topics include:

- Working with prototype and dynamic elements
- Using bind, call, and apply
- Using the Fisher–Yates formula
- When to use `e.preventDefault()` and when to avoid it
- Drag-and-drop life cycle
- Using prototypical inheritance to optimize your code
