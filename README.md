## Sortable Table and Arrays

This repository demonstrates a portfolio piece that addresses some of the common interview questions on arrays, sorting algorithms, and optimizing code performance. In preparing for the next technical interview with further understanding of key concepts, such as the insertion sort and merge sort algorithms, as well as how to create algorithms. This code was based off the course "Web Portfolio Projects: Sortable Table and Arrays" by Leigh Lawhon.

Topics include:

* Sorting your table efficiently
* Filtering null values and sorting nodes
* Sorting algorithms, including merge sort and insertion sort
* Performance testing
* Creating your own algorithm
* Design components
* Adding icons
